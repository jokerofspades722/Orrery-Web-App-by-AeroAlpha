# Orrery Web App

An interactive web application that visualizes the solar system and provides information on near-Earth objects. Built with Three.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to explore celestial bodies, adjust simulation parameters, and learn about each planet's characteristics.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: Displays multiple planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) with unique textures and colors.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Hover over planets for detailed information (name, radius, distance from the Sun, orbital period).
  - Adjust simulation speed with a slider.
  - Change camera modes (orbit, top view, follow a specific object).
  - Toggle visibility of planetary orbits.
- **User Customization**: Select a planet to follow with the camera for a personalized experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- **Assets**: Images for planet textures and the Sun

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of NASA Near Earth Object Web Service for real-time data on near-Earth objects.
- Access to NASA Solar System Dynamics data for improved simulation accuracy.
- Additional educational resources to support user learning.
